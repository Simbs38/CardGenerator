The main file uses the code on this folder to execute the features of the program.

The [CardMaker](CardMaker.py) represents the key features of the tool, since it is the main file to build the cards using the helping classes.

There are 3 types of possible inputs, [Images](ImgInput.py), [Text](TextInput.py) and [Groups](GroupInput.py), and each of them is handled by its own class.
